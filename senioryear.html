<h5>My Senior Year</h5>
<body>



<h1>In my senior year at Marshwood Highschool, I was the captain of the varsity boys soccer team along with two others. In this year, the team overall record ended as 8-5-0. Marshwood is in class A for highschool boys soccer, and even with the big Portland teams, Marshwood had the third best offense in the league. It all started with an overtime win against a Cheverus team that only had one loss after 5 games into the season. Our offense was not clicking in the first half of the game other than one opportunity off of a corner kick which our defender, Nevan, converted on. In the second half Cheverus tied it up at one to one with a nice shot from just inside of the eighteen yard box.
    The game couldn't be decided by regulation time so we had to go into two five minute halves of golden goal, sudden death. Sudden death went through the first half with no goals. The second half of overtime saw a few shots clear of the post and free of the goal. With approximately one minute left in the game, our leading scorer from the team, and my close friend, Jason, got fouled right on the top of the eighteen yard box. This was a very good scoring opportunity and Jason knew what was riding on this shot. He stepped up and nailed the shot, bottom left hand corner with thirty three seconds on the clock. Game over.</h1>
